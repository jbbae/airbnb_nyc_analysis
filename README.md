# Home buyerâ€™s guide to Airbnb: NYC
In the interest of exploring the potential for purchasing a condo in NYC, I dug into Airbnb's datasets listings & reviews datasets for the last 4 years (2015-2019) to better understand:
1. Overall Market (trends, average prices, segments)
2. Potential Neighborhoods (which neighborhoods is best?)
3. Configuration (how many bedrooms & bathrooms?)
4. Rating Categories (which ones matter, how to do well)

This repo contains all the details of the CRISPR-DM analysis performed to generate key insights.

## Installation
To run the scripts in the Jupyter notebooks, you will only require the Anaconda distribution of Python (v3.0+).

## File Descriptions
**Notebooks**

There are 5 notebooks that comprise this analysis:
1. [Airbnb NYC Data Exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/nickbae91/airbnb_nyc_analysis/blob/master/Airbnb%20NYC%20Data%20Exploration.ipynb): The bulk of our analysis
2. [Calendar - Booking Rate.ipynb](https://github.com/nickbae91/airbnb_nyc_analysis/blob/master/Calendar%20-%20Booking%20Rate.ipynb): Data mining to generate the average monthly booking rates for each listing in 2018-2019.
3. [Alternative Models.ipynb](https://github.com/nickbae91/airbnb_nyc_analysis/blob/master/Model%20Variation%20-%20Lasso.ipynb): Work to test alternative modelling options (Lasso, Ridge, Decision Trees)
4. [Listings Time Series.ipynb](https://github.com/nickbae91/airbnb_nyc_analysis/blob/master/Listings%20Time%20Series.ipynb): Time series plot of # of listings (NYC & by region).
5. [Reviews Time Series.ipynb](https://github.com/nickbae91/airbnb_nyc_analysis/blob/master/Reviews%20Time%20Series.ipynb): Time series plot of # of reviews (NYC & by region).

**Output**

In addition to the above notebooks, there also are a few key data files:
1. [mBookRates.csv](https://github.com/nickbae91/airbnb_nyc_analysis/blob/master/mBookRates.csv): Monthly booking rates by listing, generated by _Calendar - Booking Rate.ipynb_
2. [model_X.csv](https://github.com/nickbae91/airbnb_nyc_analysis/blob/master/model_X.csv): Variables for training & testing.
3. [model_y.csv](https://github.com/nickbae91/airbnb_nyc_analysis/blob/master/model_y.csv): Parameters for training & testing.
