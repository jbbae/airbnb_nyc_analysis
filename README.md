# Home buyerâ€™s guide to Airbnb: NYC
In the interest of exploring the potential for purchasing a condo in NYC, I dug into Airbnb's datasets listings & reviews datasets for the last 4 years (2015-2019) to better understand:
1. Overall Market (trends, average prices, segments)
2. Potential Neighborhoods (which neighborhoods is best?)
3. Configuration (how many bedrooms & bathrooms?)
4. Rating Categories (which ones matter, how to do well)

This repo contains all the details of the CRISPR-DM analysis performed to generate key insights.
